objective :
- purpose is for improving correcting on spell check, 
	1. dective if right or wrong
	2. if wrong suggest the right one 
	3. 
- ways to impliment:
	1. check in dict and ons on the most correct || switch the characters
	2. predefine rules, for example: ត​  with ទ
	3. search in dict, if not then => to mostly likely go for the nearest one. (edit distance)


- suggestion : using searching ponatic or Romanization words, hard using native lang

- new 2 elements 
	1. convert into Romanization words, check symspell python,
	2. g2p

TrieNode is good for string, easy to search. also use for the searching distances
